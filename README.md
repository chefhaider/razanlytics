# Bitcoin Price Forecasting using Twitter Sentiments

## Project background

Bitcoin is a form of electronic cash with no governing financial institution which can be
used for online transactions or as an exchange between any two parties. In recent years
Bitcoin has taken over the world by storm. According to a study, there have been over
100 Million investors in bitcoin with 668 Million transactions up till now. Much like the
stock market, different techniques are applied for forecasting so as to know when to buy
or sell the cryptocurrency in order to gain maximum profit.
The cryptocurrency market has been volatile from the beginning but the last few months
have been particularly a wild ride. There are numerous factors that contribute to its
volatility that also makes the market challenging to predict accurately.
One of the prime factors that contribute to its volatility is that Bitcoin does not have a
central governing authority and is controlled by the general public. For this reason, its
price is affected by socially constructed opinions.
Primarily there are three techniques that are used to predict the market. Fundamental
Analysis, Technical Analysis, and Lastly Sentiment Analysis. Using these three
techniques we can have better insights for forecasting.
Sentiment analysis is a technique through which a piece of text can be analyzed to
determine the sentiment behind it. It combines machine learning and natural language
processing (NLP) to achieve this.
In regard to this context, Sentiments can arise from public opinion, let them be opinions
of government officials, celebrities, experts, or any person that is influenced by this
world.
When it comes to influencing the public Twitter has the potential to be more influential,
more than Facebook; especially when it comes to the dissemination of news. Scientists
are increasingly recognizing Twitter's predictive power for a wide range of events, and
particularly for financial markets [1]
There are several hundreds of million bitcoin-related tweets, most of them spreading the
news about how bitcoin is performing and speculations about how it will perform in the
future. The idea is to use various machine learning techniques to find any correlation
between public opinion and the actual price fluctuation and then actually forecasting the
price fluctuation as these tweets continue to happen.



## Objective

Tweet sentiment analysis is an active field for studies in price forecasting. Using
Twitter in sentiment analysis for Bitcoin has gained researchers interest in it, due to
the large amount of news feeds per minute regarding Bitcoin. Our aim is to try
improving over existing research works, with various machine learning and deep
learning models by trying different methodologies and features. Furthermore, with
the outcome of our research work we will provide a platform for Realtime bitcoin
forecasting based on sentiments of tweets.
